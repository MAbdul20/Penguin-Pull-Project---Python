Let's make it functional first.

The idea was to make a program that can take pictures
of penguins, then display them on a website, but also
prove to be a way to test for whether or not an uploaded 
picture is a penguin based on the data. Some 

This is too high level at the moment.

High level? BULLSHIT THIS IS MACHINE LEARNING LEVEL! I WOULD HAVE TO GET A SERVER TO STORE ALL THE FUCKING PENGUIN PICTURES! JEEZ!

LEt's make it much smaller.

A script to pull a picture of a penguin from the internet, a specific picture, then show it to the program runner.

DONE! :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
